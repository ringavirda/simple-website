# Simple Website

This is a simple single page app, that displays some text, retrieves a sting from the webapi and downloads a file from an FTP server.

Certificates are not included.

Technologies used:

- dotnet 8.0
- npm 10.3.0
- angular 17.1.0

I didn't push internal hostnames and IPs, so everything is listening on the localhost standard ports 4200 and 5000 respectively.
To build this thing use standard commands.

Back-end side:

> dotnet watch

Front-end side:

> ng serve
