# Simple Website
Code for the website used in Lab 10. It's just a single page app, that displays some text, retrieves a sting from the webapi and downloads a file from an FTP server.

Certificates are not included.

Technologies used:
- dotnet 8.0
- npm 10.3.0
- angular 17.1.0

I didn't push internal hostnames and IPs, so everything is listening on the localhost standard ports 4200 and 5005 respectively.
To build this thing use standard commands.

Back-end side:
> dotnet watch

Front-end side:
> ng serve
